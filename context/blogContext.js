      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Why Certified Document Translation Matters in Legal Processes</h1>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Legal systems rely heavily on <strong>accuracy</strong> and <strong>clarity</strong>. 
        Whether you're applying for a visa, attending court, or signing international agreements, 
        the role of <strong>certified translation</strong> is crucial. Inaccurate translations can 
        lead to rejected applications, legal disputes, or even financial penalties.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What is a Certified Translation?</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        A certified translation is one that is officially validated by a translator or agency. 
        It includes a signed statement declaring that the translation is accurate and complete to the best of the translator‚Äôs knowledge.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why It‚Äôs Important in Legal Contexts:</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Legal terms must be interpreted correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> Many courts and government bodies only accept certified translations.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Certified translators are bound by professional ethics and legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Documents That Often Require Certification:</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Birth and marriage certificates</li>
        <li>Legal contracts and affidavits</li>
        <li>Immigration documents</li>
        <li>Academic transcripts</li>
        <li>Business agreements</li>
      </ul>

      <br/>

      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Ignoring this requirement could result in document rejection or delays in important processes.

      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Top 5 Mistakes to Avoid When Notarizing Documents Abroad</h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Notarizing documents overseas can feel like a maze. If you're handling <strong>legal, financial, or immigration paperwork</strong>, 
        one small error might cause weeks of delays. Let‚Äôs break down the <strong>top mistakes people make</strong> and how you can avoid them.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Using a Notary Who‚Äôs Not Recognized Locally</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">
        Some countries have strict laws about what counts as a ‚Äúvalid‚Äù notary. Always check if the notary you're using abroad is 
        officially recognized and whether their seal/signature is accepted by local authorities.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Forgetting Apostille Requirements</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">
        If the country you‚Äôre in is part of the <strong>Hague Apostille Convention</strong>, you might need an apostille certificate 
        for your notarized document to be accepted back home.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Submitting Poorly Translated Documents</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">
        If your document isn‚Äôt in the language of the country where you‚Äôre notarizing it, it might be rejected. 
        <strong>Certified translation</strong> is often required.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Overlooking Document Formatting</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">
        Many countries require documents to follow certain formats: margins, paper size, and even ink color may matter. 
        Don‚Äôt ignore those small details.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Missing Signatures or Stamps</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        A document without all required stamps or signatures ‚Äî from both you and the notary ‚Äî can be instantly disqualified. 
        Double-check before submitting.
      </p>
